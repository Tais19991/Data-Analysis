## Space Missions EDA
### Overview
This dataset, sourced from nextspaceflight.com, encompasses space missions from the beginning of the Space Race in 1957. The analysis provides insights into various aspects of these missions, including the frequency of launches, mission statuses, financial expenditures, and more.

### Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- Organisation: The organization responsible for the space mission.
- Location: The launch site.
- Date: The date when the launch occurred.
- Rocket_Status: The current status of the rocket (e.g., Active or Retired).
- Price: The cost associated with the mission.
- Mission_Status: The outcome of the mission (e.g., Success, Failure).

### Key Visualizations
- Correlation Map   
A heatmap is used to visualize correlations between numerical features in the dataset, helping to identify relationships between variables.

- Number of Space Mission Launches by Top 20 Organisations   
A bar chart illustrates the number of space missions launched by the top 20 organizations, categorized by mission status.

- Timeline of Space Missions by Organisation   
A timeline chart displays the distribution of space missions over time for various organizations, highlighting the total number of launches.

- Rocket Status Distribution  
A pie chart shows the percentage of active versus retired rockets, providing a snapshot of the current state of rockets in use.

- Overall Mission Status Distribution  
A bar chart presents the distribution of mission statuses across all missions, visualizing the proportion of successes, failures, and other outcomes.

- Mission Price Distribution  
A histogram depicts the distribution of mission prices, showing how costs vary among different missions.
 
- Launch Sites  
A scatter plot on a geographic map displays the locations of launch sites, with animation to show changes over time.

- Space Launch Distribution by Country  
A bar chart illustrates the number of space launches by country of the launch site, reflecting global space activity.

- Number of Failures by Country  
A choropleth map indicates the number of mission failures by country of the launch organization, highlighting regions with higher failure rates.

- Sunburst Diagram of Countries, Organisations, and Mission Status  
A sunburst chart provides a hierarchical view of countries, organizations, and mission statuses, showing the distribution and relationship among these categories.

- Total Expenditure by Organization  
A bar chart reveals the total expenditure by different organizations on space missions, showcasing financial investments in space exploration.

- Expenditure per Launch  
A bar chart shows the average expenditure per launch by organization, giving insight into the cost efficiency of each organization.

- Launches per Year  
A line plot demonstrates the number of space missions per year, illustrating trends and changes in launch frequency over time.

- Launches per Month  
A line and scatter plot depict the number of launches per month, providing a detailed view of launch activity on a monthly basis.

### Installation and Usage
For running this analysis, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You may need to install packages such as plotly, seaborn, and matplotlib if not already available.
