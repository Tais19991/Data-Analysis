# Lung Disease Detection Model

## Overview
This project aims to classify lung diseases using deep learning techniques on chest X-ray images. The model is trained to differentiate between multiple lung disease classes based on image patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled chest X-ray images, categorized into different disease types. The images are preprocessed and fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification.

## Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: The model utilizes multiple convolutional layers to extract key features from X-ray images.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU is used for hidden layers, and Softmax is applied to the output layer for multi-class classification.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient training.

## Data Preprocessing
- Image resizing and normalization.git add ChestXRay_Disease_Classification_CNN/README.md
- Data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
- Splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

## Training & Evaluation
- The model is trained on the processed dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate performance.
- Confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into misclassifications.

## Results
demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in medical imaging applications.
